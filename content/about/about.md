### ***About Myanmar***

Before introducing myself, I would like to introduce about my country, [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) which is one of the Southeast Asia countries. My country is bordered Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. The country's capital city is **Naypyidaw**, and its largest city is __Yangon(Rangoon)__.<br>
Our country's area is 676,578 km2 and the population is 53,582,855. Most of the people are Buddhism and there are also Christianity and Islam. I would like to show **the most famous places** in our country.
